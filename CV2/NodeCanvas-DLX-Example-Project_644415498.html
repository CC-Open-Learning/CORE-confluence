                    <p>The NodeCanvas DLX Example Project is a DLX example of a basic computer inspection process. It uses a series of graphs, state machines, and dialogue trees. The game starts by running a state machine graph that uses a new task called randomizing active objects, essentially randomizing damaged computer hardware on our desktop. The user then has to identify each part, and by having a dialogue graph for each computer part, the user has to answer whether the part is damaged or not using the prompt in the dialogue system. Based on the original randomization, the graphs check if it's correct.</p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper image-center-wrapper"><img class="confluence-embedded-image image-center" loading="lazy" src="attachments/644415498/644382770.png" data-image-src="attachments/644415498/644382770.png" data-height="972" data-width="1629" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="644382770" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="image-20230301-140858.png" data-base-url="https://varlab-dev.atlassian.net/wiki" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="644415498" data-linked-resource-container-version="1" data-media-id="877925e6-57b0-4e07-8e3d-9048632e943c" data-media-type="file"></span><p><strong>Nest Graphs</strong></p><p>There is an example of nested graphs because the main graph that starts when the scene loads run in a game loop to make it replayable, and it has all of the hardware dialogue graphs as nodes and the randomization graph, which runs throughout the game loopâ€”serving as an example of how we can have nested graphs instead of one graph.</p><p><strong>Graph Types</strong></p><p>State Machines, Dialogue Trees, and the blackboard are all used to make these multigraphs function together and create all the necessary functionality to make this inspection game work. The Dialogue trees would likely be used often to simulate instructions in DLX projects and the state machines for task flows. </p><p><strong>Custom Tasks</strong></p><p>The randomization of hardware is way beyond the built-in tasks, so this project also demonstrates custom tasks by having a randomized action task our randomization graph uses to make the game different each time it's played randomly.</p><p><strong>Automated Testing</strong></p><p>The project also demonstrates automated testing of graphs through its test cases that test its subgraphs to ensure they perform as expected with simulated input.</p>
