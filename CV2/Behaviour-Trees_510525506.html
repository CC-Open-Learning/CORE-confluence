                    <p>Behaviour trees are a game development concept commonly used for controlling the behaviour and decision making of an AI entity. They differ from Finite State Machines (FSMs) in that they are hierarchical, consisting of branches and leaves. Each branch is made up of either utility nodes (“composites” and “decorators”) that end in a leaf node (“action” or “condition” nodes), or just a leaf node itself.</p><p>With a composite node at the top, each child branch of the tree will be executed in left-to-right order, unlike an FSM, which navigates its nodes based on conditionals. Custom scripted tasks can be created to be used as leaf nodes. The BehaviourTrees work best for behaviours that update inside the game loop.</p><p>For the VARLab’s simulations, the FSMs are more suitable for our overall top-level graph scenarios. However, BehaviourTrees can be useful for small, dynamic, reusable behaviours when needed (for example, the inspectables in the Trucking simulation.)</p><h2 id="BehaviourTrees-UseinPrecisionMachining">Use in PrecisionMachining</h2><p>While we currently don’t have plans to incorporate BehaviourTrees into Precision Machining, they will be easy to incorporate in the future if we find a use case for them. Sub-BehaviourTrees and Sub-DialogueTrees can be added as child nodes to the FSM that will act as our top-level graph scenario. The hierarchical nature of the behaviour trees makes them currently unsuitable for the quizzes and mini games we have planned for Precision Machining, which require navigation between different states.</p><p>The purpose of this guide is to act as a tutorial in the event we incorporate BehaviourTrees into Precision Machining, or for any future projects that may wish to use BehaviourTrees.</p><h2 id="BehaviourTrees-FurtherInformation">Further Information</h2><p>For tutorials on how to use nodeCanvas' BehaviourTrees, refer to the pages below.</p><ul><li><p><a href="Creating-Loops-in-BehaviourTrees_510558227.html" data-linked-resource-id="510558227" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="page">Creating Loops in BehaviourTrees</a></p></li><li><p>Using Conditionals in BehaviourTrees</p></li></ul><p>Or, read <a class="external-link" href="https://nodecanvas.paradoxnotion.com/documentation/?section=behaviour-trees" rel="nofollow">nodeCanvas' official documentation on BehaviourTrees</a>.</p>
