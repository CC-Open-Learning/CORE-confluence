                    <h1 id="NetcodeForGameObjectsConceptsGuide-Authority"> Authority</h1><p>Authority in the sense of a multiplayer game means who has authority over an object, meaning who is allowed to manipulate it. There are two main types of authority: </p><ul><li><p><strong>Server Authority - </strong>The server has full authority over the object, and only the server is allowed to manipulate it </p></li><li><p><strong>Client Authority - </strong>A singular client has authority over an object, and that client can manipulate the object without needing to be validated by the server.</p></li></ul><p>Typically, we want as many things to have server authority as possible; this is because it means we, as developers, have full control over what happens with said object. If something is controlled by the client, they can give fake data, and the server will say it is ok and allow it.</p><p>For the most part, full server authority is no issue. However, sometimes, it can be tricky to decide who to give authority to. One example of this is player movement. Think about what needs to occur if player movement is controlled by the server:</p><ol start="1"><li><p>The player sends movement information</p></li><li><p>The server receives movement information and confirms if it is valid</p></li><li><p>The server will move the player or not depending on whether the movement is valid</p></li><li><p>This information is then sent to all clients and is finally updated for everyone</p></li></ol><p>This takes time and will cause noticeable input lag on the player's end, but it will prevent any movement cheats. If we have client authority, this is what occurs:</p><ol start="1"><li><p>The client moves and sends this information to everyone</p></li></ol><p>This is much quicker, but a player can now cheat by lying about where they are. Authority can be tricky sometimes, and you will usually have to cut your losses somewhere.</p>
