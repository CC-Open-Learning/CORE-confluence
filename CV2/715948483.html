This means that the people developing them should not rely on complex interface models that they take for granted.</p><p>Developers might not be familiar with the audience’s lingo and using it incorrectly will take the user out of the experience. Make sure to always validate the design with the Content Experts.</p><p>When designing your interface, keep the goal of the interaction in mind. What is the concept that you are trying to get across? How does the user show us that they understand the concept? Are we leading the user to the developer’s intended flow or are we following the process that they would follow in the real world? The objective might be getting as close to digital twinning as possible or it might be an abstract representation of the actual interaction. Make sure you know which one is the appropriate one for your case and be consistent (i.e. try not to jump from one approach to the other constantly).</p><h3 id="UX/UIDesignPrinciples-Consistency">Consistency</h3><p>UI is at its best when it’s invisible. This does not mean that users don’t see it or that it is out of the way, it means that users are not constantly thinking “this is a User Interface”. One of the main things that make this thought pop up is having clashing styles and elements that constantly change their shape and/or colour even in the same user flow.</p><p>To avoid taking people out of the situation, designers and developers must aim towards a consistent look and feel for their UI. This is achieved by following design patters (always use the same padding, margins, button positions, and so on) and following already established interfacing standards (the “close” button should be at the top right if it is an [X], if you have an OK button you usually have a Cancel one next to it or if there is no canceling, your OK button will be centered). If for one type of interaction you have your call to action on a button that says “Next”, don’t swap that for a “Continue” in the following step.</p><p>Avoid making your user constantly relearn the way they interact with the UI. Using a standardized library and reusable components/prefabs should help changes to the base element to be reflected across your application. Always check that these changes don’t create conflicts across the different implementations and remember that these elements might be in use by other teams so making changes will impact the way they are using them as well.</p><h3 id="UX/UIDesignPrinciples-UsableandAccessible">Usable and Accessible</h3><p /><p /><h2 id="UX/UIDesignPrinciples-UXPrinciples">UX Principles</h2><h3 id="UX/UIDesignPrinciples-UsabilityHeuristics">Usability Heuristics</h3><p>These are principles that everyone should always refer to when designing an interface. When reading this you might think that a lot of them are just common sense things, and that is exactly what UX is about. That being said, while designing interfaces it is very easy to focus on getting the current task done and one might overlook some (or all!) of these, so it is always good to check back and make sure that the design doesn’t clash with these principles.</p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper image-center-wrapper"><img class="confluence-embedded-image image-center" loading="lazy" src="attachments/715948483/715587747.png" data-image-src="attachments/715948483/715587747.png" data-height="1584" data-width="1152" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="715587747" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="Heuristic_Summary1-compressed-1.png" data-base-url="https://varlab-dev.atlassian.net/wiki" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="715948483" data-linked-resource-container-version="1" data-media-id="a86cc834-6e68-48ff-8471-24f8b5548501" data-media-type="file"></span><p><a class="external-link" href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/" rel="nofollow">Full article</a></p><h3 id="UX/UIDesignPrinciples-Fitts&#39;Law">Fitts' Law</h3><p>Perhaps one of the most commonly referred to principles in UX, Fitts' Law gets us to think about design aimed towards optimization in the user interface.</p><p>The simple interpretation is that when designing, we should be conscious of the distance between the user’s position and their interaction’s goal. For example: if a user clicks on a button that will unfold a menu, that menu should be next to the place where the user clicked and not across the screen:</p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper image-center-wrapper"><img class="confluence-embedded-image image-center" loading="lazy" src="attachments/715948483/715587754.png" data-image-src="attachments/715948483/715587754.png" data-height="2532" data-width="2404" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="715587754" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="image-20230528-163443.png" data-base-url="https://varlab-dev.atlassian.net/wiki" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="715948483" data-linked-resource-container-version="1" data-media-id="cedcd794-e874-41bb-8ff6-635e763c6163" data-media-type="file"></span><p>Not following this principle leaves more room for human error, either by risking the user missing out the result of their interaction, misclicking when going towards their intended target or simply by extending the required time to interact with the system, making the interaction less efficient than it could be.</p><p>This does not apply only to cursor/touch based interactions. Take this into account when designing your feedback system. If your feedback about a task being completed is far away from the place where the user completed the task, they might miss it. If they failed the task, there’s a chance of them never finding out that they failed and thinking the interaction is broken.</p><h3 id="UX/UIDesignPrinciples-Interactionfeedback">Interaction feedback</h3><p />
