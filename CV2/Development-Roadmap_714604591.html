</div><hr/><h2 id="DevelopmentRoadmap-DefinetheProblem">Define the Problem</h2><p><br/>With the approach to building an analytical solution for the DLX projects, it is important to outline the details and considerations needed to encompass each application and simulation.  Here are some key aspects to explore when defining the problem:<br/></p><ol start="1"><li><p>Understand the Project Requirements</p><ol start="1"><li><p>Gather the specific needs and expectations of stakeholders (Ex. instructors and administrators).</p></li><li><p>Clearly outline and define the purpose for building an analytical solution and the desired outcomes from the solution where an existing analytic tool is unable to accomplish the task.</p></li><li><p>Identify any specific constraints or limitations for designing an analytical solution, such as time, budget, or technical requirements.<br/></p></li></ol></li><li><p>Define the Metrics and Data Points</p><ol start="1"><li><p>Determine the metrics that will be needed to be tracked by the analytical solution. These may include:</p><ol start="1"><li><p>Total instructional hours per DLX</p></li><li><p>Instructional hours per student</p></li><li><p>Completion status</p></li><li><p>Time spent in simulation</p></li><li><p>Number of attempts</p></li><li><p>Highest milestone achieved</p></li></ol></li><li><p>Determine the value and insight that these metrics can provide by the analytical solution.<br/></p></li></ol></li><li><p> Scope of Solution</p><ol start="1"><li><p>Determine whether the designed analytic solution should be integrated with existing technology or be an independent system.</p></li><li><p>Evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of having the analytic solution should be integrated versus an independent system.</p></li><li><p>Consider the deployment of the analytic solution:</p><ol start="1"><li><p>Where the solution will be used (Ex. Unity)</p></li><li><p>Ensure compatibility and scalability across different environments (Ex. VConestoga) <br/></p></li></ol></li></ol></li><li><p>Privacy and Data Security</p><ol start="1"><li><p>Understand and comply with any and all relevant privacy regulations for data collection </p></li><li><p>Determine if any personally identifiable information is needed to be collected and stored, and ensure appropriate security measures are in place.</p></li><li><p>Investigate techniques that protect student privacy while obtaining meaningful insights.<br/></p></li></ol></li><li><p> End-User Needs and Use Cases</p><ol start="1"><li><p>Identify the target audience for the analytic solution ((Ex. instructors and administrators).</p></li><li><p>Understand the specific use cases and workflows where the tracked metrics will be utilized.</p></li><li><p>Determine the level of granularity required for data analysis and reporting based on user requirements.</p><ol start="1"><li><p>High-Level Granularity (no breakdown)<br/>- Ex. There have been a total of 500 instructional hours spent</p></li><li><p>Medium-Level Granularity (some breakdown)<br/>- Ex. Student X has spent 15 instructional hours. Student Y has spent 24 instructional hours.</p></li><li><p>Fine-Grained Granularity (more breakdown)<br/>- Ex. In Module 1, Student X has spent 15 instructional hours, while Student Y has spent 24 instructional hours.<br/></p></li></ol></li></ol></li></ol><p>By thoroughly understanding why developing an analytical solution is necessary to address the problem, an analytical solution can be effectively designed and developed to address the specific needs for applications and simulations of the DLX projects in Unity and Javascript.</p><h2 id="DevelopmentRoadmap-IdentifyDataSources">Identify Data Sources</h2><p>There are some considerations for identifying the data sources for tracking information for the analytical solution. From Unity to the Javascript application/simulation, there are different ways to process and handle and process data. <br/><br/><u>Unity</u></p><p>There are built-in features and components that can be utilized to gather data. The Unity Engine has an analytical package that can help capture events and components. Using the Unity scripts can help leverage and identify specific points in the application.<br/><br/><u>Javascript Application/Simulations</u></p><p>Employ libraries such as <a class="external-link" href="https://jquery.com/" rel="nofollow"><u>jQuery</u></a> to capture event handling, which is an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers.</p><p>Using frameworks such as Reach or Angular will help simplify data collection and management.<br/></p><p><u>Custom Data Collection Mechanisms</u></p><ul><li><p>Explore the possibility of integrating with external services or APIs that help capture data.</p></li><li><p>Potential use of user input and forms that prompt users to provide the required information.</p></li><li><p>Integration of an existing database, or extending the current database schema for the new data. </p></li></ul><h2 id="DevelopmentRoadmap-DesignDataModel">Design Data Model</h2><p>A data model is an abstract overview that organizes and manages the captured data that tells a story about how the events are unfolding in the environment. This helps highlight the values you need, where they come from, and how they’re structured.<br/><br/>Developing an effective data model helps provide insight into the functionality, performance, scalability, and usability of the environment and project. Most importantly, a data model centralizes the data visualization, which is important if there is data being provided from multiple sources. </p><p>With the design of the data model, <a href="https://varlab-dev.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CV2/pages/714604591/Development+Roadmap#Define-the-Problem" rel="nofollow">Defining the Problem</a> and <a href="https://varlab-dev.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CV2/pages/714604591/Development+Roadmap#Identify-Data-Sources" rel="nofollow">Identifying Data Sources</a> provide a great foundation for the direction of the model. The next steps are as follows:<br/><br/><u>Establish relationships between entities</u><br/>With a well-established and technical view of the problem and data needing to be handled, defining the specific relationships between captured data can be distinguished. Here are the types of relationships:</p><ul><li><p>One-to-one relationships</p></li><li><p>Many-to-one relationships</p></li><li><p>Many-to-many relationships</p></li></ul><p>Depending on the database and the DBMS, the relationship will need to be represented by a column(s) in each table. For example, SQL databases need to define primary and foreign keys as unique values to reference values in other tables.</p><p><br/><u>Physical Modeling</u></p><p>Provide specific detail on how the structure of the internal database(s) will be constructed, as well as connect any external data sources (Ex. Unity). The creation of the physical model will put all of the previous steps into practice. For the external data sources, think about how these will connect with the analytical solution and how these external data sources will be implemented into the data model.</p><h2 id="DevelopmentRoadmap-DefineAnalyticsApproach">Define Analytics Approach</h2><p>With the model, determine the analysis techniques and algorithms that will provide insights from the modeled and collected data. The data provided doesn’t have any value by itself, so the analytic analysis provides value and meaning to the data collected and modeled. To accomplish the extraction of value from the data, identify the appropriate statistical and machine learning methods to process and interpret the data. <br/><br/>All visualization of the analysis representations should consider the end-users for presentation.</p><h2 id="DevelopmentRoadmap-DevelopDataCollectionMechanisms">Develop Data Collection Mechanisms</h2><p>With the process of the design for the analytical solution completed, the development of the mechanisms needs to be implemented. These mechanisms need to capture the required data points within Unity and other DLX projects. The integration of the tracking mechanisms needs to properly record the desired metrics, such as event logging or timers. <br/><br/>Ensure that the data collection process is efficient, accurate, and minimally intrusive to the user experience and the existing project.</p><h2 id="DevelopmentRoadmap-ImplementDataStorageandProcessing">Implement Data Storage and Processing</h2><p>A data storage solution that meets the requirements to handle and store the collected data from the data sources (Ex. Unity). This solution should be able to handle the anticipated data volume and accommodate the defined data model from the design process.<br/><br/>Choose an appropriate data storage and database system technology that should align with the project requirements. If not provided by the chosen technology, develop data processing algorithms to aggregate, analyze, and generate meaningful insights from the collected data.</p><h2 id="DevelopmentRoadmap-CreateReportingandVisualization">Create Reporting and Visualization</h2><p>Create the system to design and develop the reporting mechanisms to present the tracked metrics and analytics results. The implementation of the system should generate visualizations, such as charts, graphs, or dashboards, to make the processed data more understandable and actionable for end-users.</p><h2 id="DevelopmentRoadmap-TestandValidate">Test and Validate</h2><p>Before deploying the analytical solution, it is essential to test and validate it thoroughly. This phase ensures that the solution is generating reliable, accurate, and actionable insights. The following are some key steps in the testing and validation process: </p><ol start="1"><li><p>Conduct functional testing: Test the solution to ensure that it is working as intended and that all the features are functioning correctly.</p></li><li><p>Validate data accuracy: Ensure that the data being collected and processed is accurate and consistent.</p></li><li><p>Conduct performance testing: Evaluate the performance of the solution to ensure that it is efficient and scalable.</p></li><li><p>Conduct user acceptance testing: Gather feedback from end-users to ensure that the solution meets their requirements and expectations.</p></li><li><p>Conduct security testing: Ensure that the solution is secure and that the data being collected and processed is protected.</p></li></ol><h2 id="DevelopmentRoadmap-DocumenttheSolution">Document the Solution</h2><p>Documentation is an essential aspect of any software solution. It provides a comprehensive overview of the solution, including its purpose, functionality, and technical details. The following are some key elements that should be included in the solution documentation:</p><ol start="1"><li><p>Introduction: Provide an overview of the solution, including its purpose and intended audience.</p></li><li><p>Solution Architecture: Describe the technical architecture of the solution, including the data model, data sources, and analytics approach.</p></li><li><p>User Guide: Provide detailed instructions on how to use the solution, including how to access the data, generate reports, and visualize the insights.</p></li><li><p>Technical Guide: Provide technical detains on how the solution works, including the data collection and process mechanisms, the algorithms used for analytics, and the software and hardware requirements.</p></li><li><p>Maintenance Guide: Provide instructions on how to maintain and support the solution over time, including how to troubleshoot issues and make updates and improvements.</p></li></ol><h2 id="DevelopmentRoadmap-DeployandMaintain">Deploy and Maintain</h2><p>Once the solution has been tested, validated, and documented, the final step is to deploy and maintain it. This involves ensuring that the solution is properly integrated into the existing technology stack and that it is supported and maintained over time. The following are some key steps in the deployment and maintenance process:</p><ol start="1"><li><p>Prepare for deployment: Ensure that the solution is properly configured and that all the necessary components are in place.</p></li><li><p>Conduct user training: Provide training to end-users on how to use the solution and how to interpret the insights generated. </p></li><li><p>Monitor performance: Continuously monitor the performance of the solution to ensure that it is functioning correctly and efficiently.</p></li><li><p>Address issues: Address any issues or bugs that arise in a timely manner to ensure that the solution remains reliable and effective.</p></li><li><p>Iterate and Improve: Continuously iterate and improve the solution based on user feedback and evolving requirements to ensure that it remains relevant and effective over time.</p></li></ol><p /><p>After defining the problem, identifying data sources, designing the data model, and implementing the data storage and processing, the next step is to test and validate the analytical solution. This entails ensuring that the data is being accurately collected, processed, and analyzed and that the results being generated are reliable, accurate, and actionable.</p><p>Once the solution has been thoroughly tested and validated, the next step is to document the solution. This documentation should provide a detailed overview of the solution, including the problem statement, the data sources used, the data model and schema, the analytics approach, and the reporting and visualization mechanisms.</p><p>After documenting the solution, the final step is to deploy and maintain the analytical solution. This involves ensuring that the solution is integrated into the existing technology stack and that it is properly maintained and supported over time. This includes monitoring the performance of the solution, addressing any issues that arise, and continuously iterating and improving the solution based on user feedback and evolving requirements.</p><p />
